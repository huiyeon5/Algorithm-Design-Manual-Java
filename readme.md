# Algorithm Design Manual

This repository is to store all my implementations of the algorithms in the book in Java. 

## How to run code:

All of the codes are runnable with the following commands (Assuming you have Java installed)

1. javac -d . CLASSNAME.java
2. javac chapter(NUM).CLASSNAME

Some of the code require inputs as they are answers to programming questions from https://uva.onlinejudge.org. Below are the list of questions in each chapter.

#### Chapter 1
1. ![3n + 1 Problem](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?Itemid=8&option=com_onlinejudge&page=show_problem&problem=36)
2. ![The Trip Problem](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=1078)

#### Chapter 2
1. ![Primary Arithmetic](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=976)

Please find the necessary inputs from the links mentioned above.
